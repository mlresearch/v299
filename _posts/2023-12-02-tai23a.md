title: 'SCONE: A Food Scooping Robot Learning Framework with Active Perception'
section: Poster
openreview: yHlUVHWnBN
abstract: "Effectively scooping food items poses a substantial challenge for current
  robotic systems, due to the intricate states and diverse physical properties of
  food. To address this challenge, we believe in the importance of encoding food items
  into meaningful representations for effective food scooping. However, the distinctive
  properties of food items, including deformability, fragility, fluidity, or granularity,
  pose significant challenges for existing representations. In this paper, we investigate
  the potential of active perception for learning meaningful food representations
  in an implicit manner. To this end, we present SCONE, a food-scooping robot learning
  framework that leverages representations gained from active perception to facilitate
  food scooping policy learning. SCONE comprises two crucial encoding components:
  the interactive encoder and the state retrieval module. Through the encoding process,
  SCONE is capable of capturing properties of food items and vital state characteristics.
  In our real-world scooping experiments, SCONE excels with a $71%$ success rate when
  tasked with 6 previously unseen food items across three different difficulty levels,
  surpassing state-of-the-art methods. This enhanced performance underscores SCONE’s
  stability, as all food items consistently achieve task success rates exceeding $50%$.
  Additionally, SCONE’s impressive capacity to accommodate diverse initial states
  enables it to precisely evaluate the present condition of the food, resulting in
  a compelling scooping success rate. For further information, please visit our website:
